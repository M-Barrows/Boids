This is my implementation of Boids Algorithm. This project is a means to: 

1. Provide me an introduction to PyGame.
2. Fulfil a desire to add my own spin on the Boids Algorithm demonstration. 
3. Be Fun. 

I don't expect a polished product to result from this repo nor do I expect to add any novel ideas to the discussion. That said, if you have any questions or suggestions about the code you find here, please reach out as I'd love to discuss them with you!
